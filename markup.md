## User Stories 
This web app is really fantastic. My favourite password storage tool; especially with its excellent business features.

Thanks for the great tool. You are really the best. I can now manage my remote business much more effectively!

Our business struggled to manage all of our employee and user passwords. Thanks to securePass, we can easily manage all of them in one place. 

I can now create passwords on any website and store them all in one place, so I will never forget!

I really love how all mysites passwords are organized by catergory social , work related , entertainment etc.


## project requirements

1. user can register/login and be assigned to an organization
an organization has many users

1. user can add a new username and password for a specific website


2. app can generate passwords based on the criteria specified (password length, contains lowercase, contairs uppercase, contains numbers, etc)

1. user can edit and change their password any time

1. user has a convinient copy to clipboard button so they dont have to select the password

1. X sites can be categoried, to, social (fb, linkedin), work related (bamboo, harvest), entertainment (snapchat, reddit), etc, etc
For this app, it is ok to store the passwords as string but remember that this is not the way for production apps! 

1. As a stretch feature, consider storing a masterkey, which is used to encrypt each and de-encrypt incoming information from the server to the client. Reading into what salting is for passwords will be the first step for this stretch.
